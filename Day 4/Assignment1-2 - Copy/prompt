Question 2:
Caitlyn loved chocolates and asked her mum to buy her a truck of chocolates. Her mum wasn't as generous, but she did buy Cait a tiny chocolate dispenser. However, she didn't teach Cait how to operate it. She would only give her one chocolate a day. Cait obviously wanted more, so much more.
Cait is now on a quest to create a virtual terminal which can directly access the chocolate machine. She needs YOU to help her code functionalities in the back-end though.
Trial 1: MORE! MORE! MORE!
Hundred chocolates? Not enough! We certainly need more. Create a function addChocolates() which takes color, count as arguments and adds them to the dispenser from the top.
Trial 2: LESS! LESS! LESS!
We have added too many chocolates and the machine has started to malfunction. Create a function removeChocolates() that takes number as an argument and returns an array of chocolates that have been removed from the top.
Trial 3: One is not enough!
Cait can't have just one chocolate a day. So our next task would be to create a function dispenseChocolates() that dispenses chocolate at will. It takes number as an argument and returns an array of chocolates from the bottom.
Trial 4: My favourite color is...
Cait is annoyed with all the green chocolates she's been getting. Time to change things up a bit. Create a function dispenseChocolatesOfColor() which takes number, color as arugments and return an array of chocolates from the bottom of the given color.
Trial 5: LED my chocos!
Cait is finding it difficult to keep track of her chocolates. You'll need to create an LED that shows her how many of each chocolate are remaining. Create a function noOfChocolates() that returns an array of number of chocolates in the order [green, silver, blue, crimson, purple, red, pink].
Trial 6: Let's stack em up!
Cait wants to eat a lot of chocolates, but is trying to restrain herself. Therefore she has decided to only eat chocolates that are least in number. To do this though, we need the chocolates arranged properly though. Create a function sortChocolateBasedOnCount() which sorts the chocolates in descending order of their count.
Trial 7: They taste the same!
Cait wants to able to change the color of the chocolates now. Little does she know, changing the wrapper won't change the flavor. But, well, create a function changeChocolateColor() which takes the arguments number, color, finalColor and changes n chocolates of the given color to the finalColor.
Trial 8: Convert these heretics!
Caits wants to change all chocolates of a given color to some other color. Pretty sure she's trying to get rid of all the green chocolates. Create a function changeChocolateColorAllOfxCount() which takes the argument color, finalColor and changes all chocolates of color to finalColor. It returns [countOfFinalColorChocolates, chocolates].
Challenge 1: Fresh pickings!
Cait believes that all the best and newest chocolates are the top of the machine. She needs help removing just one chocolate of the given color from the top. Create a function removeChocolateOfColor() which takes an argument color and removes one chocolate of the given color from top.
Challenge 2: Rainbows and sunshine!
Cait has found something incredible. Combining similar colored chocolates gives us an additional rainbow colored chocolate. She wants more of these, and less of her having to combine them. Create a function dispenseRainbowChocolates() which takes an argument number and returns the number of rainbow chocolates dispensed for every 3 chocolates of the same color.
