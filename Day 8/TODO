Abstraction:

A company XYZ wants to develop an app which can predict the
lucky number for a person.
The name of the app is LuckyNumberPredictor.
This app consists of a method - upon calling the person gets to know his/her lucky number.
 This method calls another class —> NumberPredictor - which have the formula for
 predicting the lucky number of that person. This approach is done so that no-one else gets
to know the secret formula for this prediction.

LuckyNumberPredictor accepts only one argument i.e: date of birth of the person. The formula
for predicting the lucky number is quite simple -> a person’s lucky number is calculated by rounding off the date of birth to the nearest Fibonacci number.
Another thought that XYZ company is  having - is to predict unlucky number as well - but for this — for now, they don’t have any formula ready. But they want to have this idea to be stored in - in their NumberPredictor class. The company is asking you to develop this system.
